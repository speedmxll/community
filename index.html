            <p><strong>"The Dog House"</strong> is an exciting, dog-themed economy board game inspired by Monopoly but with a unique twist. Players, referred to as "hoomans," compete to become the Top Dog in an economy orchestrated by their pet dogs, who are the alphas of the household. Infused with dog memes and humor, this game offers a playful and engaging experience for all ages.</p>

                        Our idea is "The Dog House," a dog-themed economy board game inspired by classics but with a unique twist.
                        In this game, hoomans navigate an economy controlled by their pet dogs, filled with humor and dog memes.
